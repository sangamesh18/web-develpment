        Typically story writing has five key elements – Character (fewer is better),</br>
        Setting (brief but poetic and vivid), Plot (as simple and interesting as possible), Conflict (intense but one), and Theme (relating to the majority of readers). A character is someone or something that takes part in actions depicted in the short story.
        It could be a living person, a dead person, a ghost, an imaginary character, a robot, a dog, a toy… an unlimited list.
