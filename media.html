        <b> A shopping mall (or simply mall) </b>is a North American term for a large indoor shopping center,
        <bdo dir="rtl" usually anchored by department stores.</bdo> The term "mall" <strong> meant a pedestrian promenade</strong> with shops along it (that is, the term was used to refer to the walkway itself which was merely bordered by such shops),
        but in the late 1960s, <i>it began to be used as a generic</i> term for the large enclosed shopping centers that were becoming commonplace at the time.[1][2] In the U.K., such complexes are considered shopping centers (Commonwealth English: shopping
        centre), though "shopping center" covers many more sizes and types of centers than the North American "mall". Other countries may follow U.S. usage (India,[3] U.A.E.,[4] etc.) and others (Australia,[5] etc.) follow U.K. usage.
