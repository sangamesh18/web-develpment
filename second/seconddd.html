<h1> first heading </h1>
<p1> Typically story writing has five key elements – Character (fewer is better), 
Setting (brief but poetic and vivid), Plot (as simple and interesting as possible), 
Conflict (intense but one), and Theme (relating to the majority of readers).</p1>
<h2> second heading </h2>
<p2>A character is someone or something that takes part in actions depicted in the short story. 
It could be a living person,
 a dead person, a ghost,
 an imaginary character, a robot, a dog, a toy… an unlimited list.</p2>
<h3> third heading </h3>
<p3>The golden rule for selecting characters in story writing is “Fewer is better”.
story writing would more effectively convey its meaning if it has very few characters – one protagonist,
 one other main character, and no supporting or side characters would be ideal.</p3>
<h4> forth heading </h4>
<p4>The animating character with perfect adjectives and examples is a must however, 
typically while writing short stories, do not fall overdo the characterization.</p4>
<h5> fifth heading </h5>
<p5>Time frame and place constitute the setting of story writing.
 The setting is often decorated with descriptions of scenes such as supermarket, bedroom, crowded metro train,
 or drizzling evening… again unlimited list. These descriptions are very important to make the reader immerse in the plot.</p5>
<h6> sixth heading </h6>
<p6>Unit of time frame may vary from hours to days to weeks to years.
 The golden rule in selecting time frame for story writing is “keep it shorter” and “have it single”.
 Story writing that has setting of few hours may typically be clearer and more effective than with setting of few months or years.
